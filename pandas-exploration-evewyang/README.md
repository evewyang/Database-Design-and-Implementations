# pandas exploration

In this assignment you will select a data set and do some munging, analysis, and visualization of it using `pandas`, Jupyter Notebooks, and associated Python-centric data science tools.

## Data selection and retrieval

### Select a data source

First, you will need to select a datafile to work from. For this assignment, please select any reputable data source that is of interest to you. Download the data in a plain text data format, not a spreadsheet-specific file format.

### Where to find data

There are many data sources available at [NYU Libraries' Data Services division](https://guides.nyu.edu/dataservices). Use all available resources to identify a data set of interest to yourself.

### Save the data

Save the original raw data file of your choice into the `data` directory.

## Jupyter Notebook

Use [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.io/) to open the Jupyter Notebook named [analysis.ipynb](./analysis.ipynb). You will import the data file and do all the data munging, analysis, and visualization within this notebook.
