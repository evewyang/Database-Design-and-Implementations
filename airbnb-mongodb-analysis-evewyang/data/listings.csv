ITALIANO:
Sono originaria dell'Italia. E 'sempre affascinante incontrare nuove persone e altre culture. Mi piace la vastità che i viaggiatori portano con se. Sono come dimensioni che si aprano e ci aiutano a percepire l'amplitudine di questo mondo.  L'ospitalità è fondamentale per me. 
Sono interessata all'arte, all'architettura, al teatro, alla gastronomia, ma la cosa più bella è che ci ritroviamo giorno dopo giorno ad imparare nuove lezioni sul mondo dei bambini, che ci insegna a vedere ed a percepire la vita da un'altra perspettiva. 
Quando andiamo in vacanze possiamo offrire il nostro appartamento. Ma siamo aperti per eccezioni di vario genere. 
Non esitate a mettervi in contatto con me.

― Nicolas Chamfort
""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

Note to Guests
• I enjoy meeting people and like to know who my guests are. Write a bit about yourself and your purpose of travelling. That way I not only get a better picture of you but can come up with valuable information and ideas to make your arrival and stay pleasent, convenient and memorable.
• A novel of your life story isn't necessary; just write about what you think someone meeting you for the first time would want to know.

PHILOSOPHY
IT’S GONNA BE LEGEN-… WAIT FOR IT… -DARY!

I like Interesting People ... But what make you interesting? I would say if you are different! That can be weird stories you believe, crazy in emotional or lifestyle way, Special things you do or did, cool stories of your live or much more.

Also i like interesting people who are bit different then other people (but be yourself).

But the main think is exchange idea, culture and get new connection.

What i like to talk: 
Aliens, Sexuality, Paranormal things, Traveling, crazy experiments, Quantenphysik, Sport, Agharta, Psychologie, to read your personalty

One of my passion is fotografie.

""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

Darum habe ich Freude viele Leute bei mir zu beherbergen. Ich kann auch, nach Anfrage für 10.-CH ein feines  Frühstück vorbereiten. Jede kann bei mir die Küche, Wohnzimmer mit TV und Balkon benützen. Ich freue mich auf Ihrem Besuch.

Je suis Française et j'habite à Zurich depuis de nombreuses années. J'aime accueillir des gens chez moi car dans mon enfance j'allais souvent chez ma grand-mère qui avait une petite pension-restaurant. Tout le monde peut utiliser la cuisine, le salon et le balcon.

I'm a 30 years old, actually young woman originally from Eastern Europe (Bosnia), but born and grew up in Switzerland. I'm open minded and treat everybody with respect (doesn't matter from where someone is coming). I love to meet new people, that's why I also try to improve my english (thanks Air BNB for giving opportunity for even a double win :-) ).
I work as a movie operator at a cinema and in a restaurant as a waitress. I love documentary movies, music from the whole world. I like playing football and love to play music (don't worry, I take consideration whenever having guests :-) ).
My social network is quite big, I can give you many recomandations about restaurants, bars, cultural events and much more. I'm very friendly and taking care of my guests. My absolutely main priority is, that everyone feels like home during the stay in my home.

""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

― Nicolas Chamfort
""Durch die Leidenschaften lebt der Mensch, durch die Vernunft existiert er bloss.""

This is my motto  in life and I try to live up to it as much as I can. I have traveled extensively for work and leisure and made invaluable experiences during my trips. I am passionate about wine, food, exotic herbs and plants. But nothing beats good company and great talks! My home is my castle I love and I care about. You are welcome to share and enjoy it with me.

I am an easy going, open minded person with a lot of interests.  I love reading  and I am an ""old school"" newspaper addict. On a Sunday morning you will most likely find me on the sofa surrounded by newspapers and magazines and well equipped with coffee and cookies to indulge in what is going on in the world.

Note to Guests
• I enjoy meeting people and like to know who my guests are. Write a bit about yourself and your purpose of travelling. That way I not only get a better picture of you but can come up with valuable information and ideas to make your arrival and stay pleasent, convenient and memorable.
• A novel of your life story isn't necessary; just write about what you think someone meeting you for the first time would want to know.

A few years ago people of different Christian denominations came up with the idea (some would call it a vision) to shape our lives after fifty, i.e. age 50+, together. In the light of this dream the non-profit cooperative building association ""InVia"" (=on the way) was founded in 2011. In the following years we looked for a suitable piece of property and we finally found one on Neeserweg in Zurich.
In November 2018 we were able to move into the apartments).
In our cooperative association there is room for different life conceptions. Our core group finds its basic values, inspiration and strength from Christian faith, lived both personally and communally. People are welcome as members as long as they respect this brand of spirituality, but they do not necessarily have to share it. We have planned a studio in the house, so that we can receive both our own and foreign guests.

I am so happy and grateful that our paths crossed even if only virtually for now! 


Let me share with you some information about myself. 
I lived in 7 countries and speak 7 languages. 
I cannot live without: traveling, sport (especially yoga and jogging), fruits, flowers and books.

Favorite continent to travel: Asia
Favorite country to live: Italy (but I LOVE Switzerland and especially Zurich where I currently live)
Favorite fruit: mango, but I go crazy about all what is in season.

Vor ein paar Jahren hat Lukas in einem Bubble Hotel in La Réunion übernachtet und war vom Erlebnis begeistert. Er hat dann zusammen mit Iwan an der Umsetzung eines solchen Projekts in der Region Zürich gearbeitet. Die beiden haben einen Weg gefunden, wie man ein Angebot gestalten könnte, waren nach erstem Standort-Misserfolg nur noch auf der Suche nach einem geeignetem Plätzchen. Durch einen glücklichen Zufall sind sie dann auf Corinne aufmerksam geworden, welche nicht nur einen wunderschönen Standort zu bieten hatte, sondern mit ihren Fähigkeiten das Team perfekt ergänzen konnte. Seit dem hat das Dreierteam daran gearbeitet, den Leuten eine unvergessliche Übernachtungsmöglichkeit zu bieten, welche gerade im Sommer 2020, wegen den vielen gescheiterten Urlaubsplänen, gerne gebucht wird.


Über uns
Iwan und Lukas haben sich während dem Studium kennengelernt und durch viele lustige gemeinsame Abende, abenteuerliche Reisen und interessante Projekte eine enge Freundschaft entwickelt.

I like doing sports like tennis, sailing, volley etc but enjoy going out in Zurichs nightlife as well. I would describe myself as very open and spontaneous and love showing people what the city has to offer. 

As son of a family working mainly in the tourism branch i had many chances to visit many countries in the world and get to know a lot of different cultures which i think is very interesting and helpful in life. The good side effect is, that I enjoy showing guest around in Zurich and ""share"" what our City offers!

I like doing sports like tennis, sailing, volley etc but enjoy going out in Zurichs nightlife as well. I would describe myself as very open and spontaneous and love showing people what the city has to offer. 

As son of a family working mainly in the tourism branch i had many chances to visit many countries in the world and get to know a lot of different cultures which i think is very interesting and helpful in life. The good side effect is, that I enjoy showing guest around in Zurich and ""share"" what our City offers! 

Having into depth discussions suit me as much as going out and having fun.

Since our parents live in Italy and Russia we became family for each other (We support each other in everyday life and in our free time we organize hikes on the mountains and walk at the lake together).

We live our lives quietly and peacefully and we enjoy our cultural mix, which never lacks in Italian-Russian delicacies of our own invention on our table.
We have different personalities: one is extroverted with a job as brand manager in international companies; and the other is more introverted and creative with a specialization in marketing and a real talent for painting and interior design.

I am so happy and grateful that our paths crossed even if only virtually for now! 


Let me share with you some information about myself. 
I lived in 7 countries and speak 7 languages. 
I cannot live without: traveling, sport (especially yoga and jogging), fruits, flowers and books.

Favorite continent to travel: Asia
Favorite country to live: Italy (but I LOVE Switzerland and especially Zurich where I currently live)
Favorite fruit: mango, but I go crazy about all what is in season. 

You will have a positive, vibrant and bubbly world citizen as host/guest with a lot of travel and life stories to tell (in lots of languages). 
Traveling, meeting new people and sharing life experiences is my biggest passion and I hope yours too. 
Hope to meet you soon and until then stay blessed, healthy and happy!
