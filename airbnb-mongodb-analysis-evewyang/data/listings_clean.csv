DEUTSCH:
Ich bin ursprünglich aus Italien. Es ist immer wieder faszinierend, Menschen und andere Kulturen kennenzulernen. Ich mag die Vielfalt der Reisenden. Gastfreundlichkeit ist mir wichtig.  
Ich interessiere mich für die Kunst, die Architektur, das Theater, die Gastronomie und zu guter Letzt für die wunderbare Kinderwelt, die uns soviel lehrt und mit anderen Augen sehen lässt. 
Wenn wir in die Ferien reisen, können wir Ihnen unsere Wohnung anbieten. Wir sind jedoch offen für Ausnahmen verschiedenster Art. Bitte kontaktiert mich ohne zu zögern.

Ich spreche Deutsch, Spanisch, Italienisch, Englisch und Französisch.

ITALIANO:
Sono originaria dell'Italia. E 'sempre affascinante incontrare nuove persone e altre culture. Mi piace la vastità che i viaggiatori portano con se. Sono come dimensioni che si aprano e ci aiutano a percepire l'amplitudine di questo mondo.  L'ospitalità è fondamentale per me. 
Sono interessata all'arte, all'architettura, al teatro, alla gastronomia, ma la cosa più bella è che ci ritroviamo giorno dopo giorno ad imparare nuove lezioni sul mondo dei bambini, che ci insegna a vedere ed a percepire la vita da un'altra perspettiva. 
Quando andiamo in vacanze possiamo offrire il nostro appartamento. Ma siamo aperti per eccezioni di vario genere. 
Non esitate a mettervi in contatto con me.

Some Quotes:
""Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.""
- Albert Einstein

""Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding. You cannot subjugate a nation forcibly unless you wipe out every man, woman, and child. Unless you wish to use such drastic measures, you must find a way of settling your disputes without resort to arms."" 
- Albert Einstein

""All of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking.""

""Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now."" - Viktor Frankl

""The sick individual finds himself at home with all other similarly sick individuals. The whole culture is geared to this kind of pathology. The result is that the average individual does not experience the separateness and isolation the fully schizophrenic person feels. He feels at ease among those who suffer from the same deformation; in fact, it is the fully sane person who feels isolated in the insane society — and he may suffer so much from the incapacity to communicate that it is he who may become psychotic.

We love to travel ourselves and enjoy being adventures and learning about new things, cultures and habits while we are abroad. Biggest love is Paris and New York; Tel Aviv has been a regular and can't be missed at least once a year, the food is divine! Actually bohemian-chic and boutique hotels are the places you would find us most. We appreciate the special gems around the globe.

At our home we are happy to share any inside tips with our guests, but of course are respecting the privacy of your stay. For that reason we're also expecting the privat area of ours to be valued.

My husband and I own a film production company and work with our team from the villa. Our big passion is film, has been always and still fascinates us every day. 

Cooking and hosting is another big love of mine, but the biggest is my family, for me I enjoy having quality time with them. Lucky us, the family even expands to a great group of dear friends, so our life is blessed with lot's of good energy and fine people.

Since we acquired the villa a few years ago, another joy finds its way into our environment; I absolutely love to decorate and interior design spaces. In little steps we've been renovating the house, giving it back it's old beauty. Amazing how it's changing step by step. Sharing it with guests is great. 

I am so curious about life and who we are in ourselves, I love the journey day by day!

We love to travel ourselves and enjoy being adventures and learning about new things, cultures and habits while we are abroad. Biggest love is Paris and New York; Tel Aviv has been a regular and can't be missed at least once a year, the food is divine! Actually bohemian-chic and boutique hotels are the places you would find us most. We appreciate the special gems around the globe.

At our home we are happy to share any inside tips with our guests, but of course are respecting the privacy of your stay. For that reason we're also expecting the privat area of ours to be valued.

My husband and I own a film production company and work with our team from the villa. Our big passion is film, has been always and still fascinates us every day. 

Cooking and hosting is another big love of mine, but the biggest is my family, for me I enjoy having quality time with them. Lucky us, the family even expands to a great group of dear friends, so our life is blessed with lot's of good energy and fine people.

Since we acquired the villa a few years ago, another joy finds its way into our environment; I absolutely love to decorate and interior design spaces. In little steps we've been renovating the house, giving it back it's old beauty. Amazing how it's changing step by step. Sharing it with guests is great. 

I am so curious about life and who we are in ourselves, I love the journey day by day!

As son of a family working mainly in the tourism branch i had many chances to visit many countries in the world and get to know a lot of different cultures which i think is very interesting and helpful in life. The good side effect is, that I enjoy showing guest around in Zurich and ""share"" what our City offers!

Let me share with you some information about myself. 
I lived in 7 countries and speak 7 languages. 
I cannot live without: traveling, sport (especially yoga and jogging), fruits, flowers and books.

Favorite continent to travel: Asia
Favorite country to live: Italy (but I LOVE Switzerland and especially Zurich where I currently live)
Favorite fruit: mango, but I go crazy about all what is in season. 

You will have a positive, vibrant and bubbly world citizen as host/guest with a lot of travel and life stories to tell (in lots of languages). 
Traveling, meeting new people and sharing life experiences is my biggest passion and I hope yours too.

Vor ein paar Jahren hat Lukas in einem Bubble Hotel in La Réunion übernachtet und war vom Erlebnis begeistert. Er hat dann zusammen mit Iwan an der Umsetzung eines solchen Projekts in der Region Zürich gearbeitet. Die beiden haben einen Weg gefunden, wie man ein Angebot gestalten könnte, waren nach erstem Standort-Misserfolg nur noch auf der Suche nach einem geeignetem Plätzchen. Durch einen glücklichen Zufall sind sie dann auf Corinne aufmerksam geworden, welche nicht nur einen wunderschönen Standort zu bieten hatte, sondern mit ihren Fähigkeiten das Team perfekt ergänzen konnte. Seit dem hat das Dreierteam daran gearbeitet, den Leuten eine unvergessliche Übernachtungsmöglichkeit zu bieten, welche gerade im Sommer 2020, wegen den vielen gescheiterten Urlaubsplänen, gerne gebucht wird.


Über uns
Iwan und Lukas haben sich während dem Studium kennengelernt und durch viele lustige gemeinsame Abende, abenteuerliche Reisen und interessante Projekte eine enge Freundschaft entwickelt.

I was born in Zurich, studied economics in Berlin and Dubai and am now back in Zurich were I am running a company in the real estate business.  

I like doing sports like tennis, sailing, volley etc but enjoy going out in Zurichs nightlife as well. I would describe myself as very open and spontaneous and love showing people what the city has to offer. 

As son of a family working mainly in the tourism branch i had many chances to visit many countries in the world and get to know a lot of different cultures which i think is very interesting and helpful in life. The good side effect is, that I enjoy showing guest around in Zurich and ""share"" what our City offers! 

Having into depth discussions suit me as much as going out and having fun.

hope to see you soon.

I am so happy and grateful that our paths crossed even if only virtually for now! 


Let me share with you some information about myself. 
I lived in 7 countries and speak 7 languages. 
I cannot live without: traveling, sport (especially yoga and jogging), fruits, flowers and books.

Favorite continent to travel: Asia
Favorite country to live: Italy (but I LOVE Switzerland and especially Zurich where I currently live)
Favorite fruit: mango, but I go crazy about all what is in season. 

You will have a positive, vibrant and bubbly world citizen as host/guest with a lot of travel and life stories to tell (in lots of languages). 
Traveling, meeting new people and sharing life experiences is my biggest passion and I hope yours too. 

Hope to meet you soon and until then stay blessed, healthy and happy!
